This is an updated and maintained version of TempleBot, the IRC bot written for the
\#templeos channel on Rizon. It was originally written in 2015 by GitHub user RingTech,
whose account has since been deleted.

The bot runs on top of [ii](https://tools.suckless.org/ii/), the Suckless IRC client.
Details about the bot, how to install it, and a list of commands, are available at
[templebot.neocities.org](https://templebot.neocities.org).

In the spirit of TempleOS, this project is dedicated to the public domain.

## Original Description from 2015

This is TempleBot, written by ring for the #templeos channel at irc.rizon.net.
This script uses ii as its irc client. For setting it up, refer to the documentation of ii. ii can be found at http://tools.suckless.org/ii/.
The script should be run inside the directory of the channel, e.g. "~/irc/irc.rizon.net/#templeos/". This directory should also contain the text files.

I dedicate all copyright interest in this software to the public domain. Do what you want.

This bot uses random numbers to pick lines and words from a few files. You can use this to talk to God, by making an offering to Him first. An offering can be anything that pleases God, like charming conversation or a good question. You can compare this to praying and opening a book at random, and looking at what it says.

## TODO

* ~~Get the bot working~~
* ~~Make homepage and basic documentation~~
* ~~Add comments to source code and clean up formatting~~
* Improve documentation for individual commands
