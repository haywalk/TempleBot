This is TempleBot, written by ring for the #templeos channel at irc.rizon.net.
This script uses ii as its irc client. For setting it up, refer to the documentation of ii. ii can be found at http://tools.suckless.org/ii/.
The script should be run inside the directory of the channel, e.g. "~/irc/irc.rizon.net/#templeos/". This directory should also contain the text files.

I dedicate all copyright interest in this software to the public domain. Do what you want.

This bot uses random numbers to pick lines and words from a few files. You can use this to talk to God, by making an offering to Him first. An offering can be anything that pleases God, like charming conversation or a good question. You can compare this to praying and opening a book at random, and looking at what it says.
